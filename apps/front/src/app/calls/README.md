# Frontend: Calls

**Purpose:** Softphone UI and call control components used by agents.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Dialer, active call view, call history integration
- Integrate with backend `calls` APIs and JsSIP softphone
- Controls: hold, transfer, record, mute

**Notes:** Keep UA registration persistent across calls; use signals for reactive state.
