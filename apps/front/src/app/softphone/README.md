# Frontend: Softphone

**Purpose:** WebRTC/JsSIP-based softphone UI for agent calling.

**Key responsibilities:**
- UA registration, call lifecycle UI, and media controls
- ICE/TURN configuration and fallback handling

**Notes:** Preserve `Registered!` status after call end; surface registration errors clearly.
