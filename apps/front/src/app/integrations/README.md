# Frontend: Integrations

**Purpose:** UI for configuring third-party integrations (webhooks, API keys, sync settings).

**Key responsibilities:**
- Connectors management, OAuth flows and token handling
- Mapping configuration and sync logs

**Notes:** Keep secrets out of client-side storage; require server-side token exchange for OAuth where possible.
