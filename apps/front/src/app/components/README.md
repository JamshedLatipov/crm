# Frontend: Components

**Purpose:** Shared presentational components used across pages (buttons, forms, lists).

**Key responsibilities:**
- Provide reusable UI primitives and patterns
- Ensure accessibility and consistent styling (Tailwind + Material)

**Notes:** Use standalone components and signals; keep components small and documented.
