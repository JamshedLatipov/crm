# Frontend: Services

**Purpose:** Client-side services for API calls, state management and shared logic.

**Key responsibilities:**
- HTTP adapters, caching, and abstraction over backend endpoints
- Signal-based state stores and cross-component communication

**Notes:** Keep services thin and testable; centralize error handling.
