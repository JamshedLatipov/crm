# pjsip.d/

**Purpose:** Directory of per-endpoint PJSIP fragments (commonly used for dynamic provisioning or DB-backed configs).

**Key notes:**
- Files here are commonly generated by provisioning scripts or DB exports.
- Useful for separating static base config (`pjsip.conf`) from generated peers.
- Avoid committing sensitive credential fragments to VCS.
